      <h2>Greetings, and welcome to my new webpage!</h2>
      <p>I'm a senior in the astrophysical sciences department at Princeton, and will be pursuing a PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics at Harvard beginning in the fall!</p>
      <p>My main scientific interests are in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology, which is the study of the history, evolution, and makeup of the universe as a whole. For example, one question which cosmologists hope to answer is: <em>What is Dark Energy, and what role has it played in the way that galaxies and galaxy clusters form?</em> As a graduate student, I will be tackling questions such as this, through some unkown combination of observational research and computational simulations.</p>
      <p>I have completed several research projects as an undergraduate (not all of them in cosmology). My <em>Research</em> page (link to the left) has descriptions of my past projects, including any reports, posters, or publications that came out of each project. My <em>CV</em> page contains an outline of my academic history to date.</p>
      <p>I am more than happy to talk to anyone who is interested in my work! Please feel free to contact me by email, or follow me on Twitter. </p>
