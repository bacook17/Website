      <h2>Welcome to my astrophysics home page!</h2>
      <p>I am a second year graduate student, studying astronomy and astrophysics at Harvard. I was at Princeton for undergrad, where I also majored in astrophysics.</p>
      <p>My main scientific focus is on the formation and evolution of
      galaxies. In particular, I'm studying the merger history of
      galaxies. Using numerical simulations of galaxy evolution, I
      investigate which observable properties of a galaxy are
      reliable indicators of its merger history.</p>
      <p>I completed several research projects as an undergraduate. My <em>Research</em> page (link to the left) has descriptions of my past projects, including any reports, posters, or publications that came out of each project. My <em>CV</em> page contains an outline of my academic history to date.</p>
      <p>I am more than happy to talk to anyone who is interested in my work! Please feel free to contact me by email, or follow me on Twitter.</p>

      <p>My research page is now complete! Select
      the <em>Research</em> tab on the left to read descriptions of
      all of my past research projects, and to view any reports or
      publications that have be produced as part of each project.</p>
      <p><strong>Feb. 6 2014</strong></p>
      <p>I was awarded one of six undergraduate Chambliss Medals (out of 300 competitors) for my poster presentation at the 223rd AAS Conference in January. <a href="http://aas.org/posts/news/2014/01/chambliss-student-poster-awards-aas-223">Check out the announcement here!</a> A copy of the poster can be found in my <em>CV</em> section.</p>
