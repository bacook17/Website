			              <h2>Greetings, and welcome to my new webpage!</h2>
				              <p>I'm a senior in the astrophysical sciences department at Princeton. I'm moving on to astronomy graduate school next year, so hopefully this page will soon be updated with information on where I'll be going, and what kinds of projects I'll be engaged in!</p>
					              <p>My main scientific interests are in cosmology, which is the study of the history, evolution, and makeup of the universe as a whole. For example, one question which cosmologists hope to answer is: <em>What is Dark Energy, and what role has it played in the way that galaxies and galaxy clusters form?</em> As a graduate student, I will be tackling questions such as this, through some unkown combination of observational research and computational simulations.</p>
						              <p>I have completed several research projects as an undergraduate (not all of them in cosmology). My <em>Research</em> page (link to the left) has descriptions of my past projects, including any reports, posters, or publications that came out of each project. My <em>CV</em> page contains an outline of my academic history to date.</p>
							              <p>I am more than happy to talk to anyone who is interested in my work! Please feel free to contact me by email, or follow me on Twitter. </p>
