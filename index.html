      <h2>Welcome to my astrophysics home page!</h2>
      <p>I am a first year graduate student, studying astronomy and astrophysics at Harvard. I was at Princeton for undergrad, where I also majored in astrophysics.</p>
      <p>My main scientific interests are in extragalactic astronomy and cosmology, which is the study of the history, evolution, and makeup of the universe as a whole. I'm curious about the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the formation and growth of galaxies and clusters, and the epoch of reionization..</p>
      <p>I have completed several research projects as an undergraduate (not all of them in cosmology). My <em>Research</em> page (link to the left) has descriptions of my past projects, including any reports, posters, or publications that came out of each project. My <em>CV</em> page contains an outline of my academic history to date.</p>
      <p>I am more than happy to talk to anyone who is interested in my work! Please feel free to contact me by email, or follow me on Twitter.</p>
