		      <h2>My Past Research Projects</h2> Although my
		      current scientific interests are primarily in
		      cosmology, I have had the opportunity to
		      complete several research projects in a variety
		      of areas during the past few years. Below are
		      descriptions of my recent work, as well as any
		      major reports compiled as part of the research.

		      2014<br>The distributions of baryons and dark
		      matter in the universe</h4>
		      <p>The cosmic baryon fraction - the fraction of
			the universe's mass which is in the form of
			ordinary matter - can be approximated through
			study of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Yet
			when measuring the collected baryonic mass in
			clusters of galaxies - some of the largest
			cosmic scales - observations consistently find
			fewer baryons than would be expected from the
			CMB measurements. For my senior thesis, I am
			attempting to collect all available
			measurements of the baryon fraction on a wide
			range of cosmic scales, from the halos around
			galaxies to the outskirts of the most massive
			clusters. My work involves an extensive review
			of the literature in order to: 1) determine
			the hot gas fraction in galaxy clusters from
			X-ray and SZ measurements and 2) establish the
			stellar fraction on a variety of scales from
			optical clustering catalogs.</p>

		      <p>Magnetic fields in the Sun are generated
			through a combination of convective and
			rotational motions at the <em>tachocline</em>,
			a boundary layer between the Sun's radiative
			core and convective outer envelope. In stars much
