      <h2>My Past Research Projects</h2> My present research interests
      are focused on the properties and evolution of galaxies. I have
      also had the opportunity to complete many research projects
      in a variety of fields during the past few years. Below are
      descriptions of my recent work, as well as any major reports
      compiled as part of the research.

	<figcaption>The <em>stellar halos</em> around galaxies (like
	NGC 474) contain complex systems of streams and shells, debris
	from galaxies which collided in the past. The properties of
	these halos encode important information about how galaxies
	grew through mergers.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>PhD Research Project: Fall 2014 &mdash; Summer
	2016<br>The link between the stellar populations of stellar halos and galaxy accretion histories</h4>
      <p>Galaxies can grow through two different means:
      the <em>in-situ</em> growth of new stars, and
      the <em>ex-situ</em> accretion of stars through
      mergers. Observations of galaxies cannot identify which stars
      were formed in-situ and which were accreted, which makes it
      difficult to study how individual
	galaxies evolved.</p>
      <p>My Research Exam project, lasting for the first two years of
      my PhD, used cosmological simulations to study how the
      properties of <em>stellar halos</em> are good diagnostic tools
      for measuring the contribution of ex-situ accretion to a
      galaxy's growth. Stellar halos are diffuse regions in the
      outskirts around galaxies, where the debris from mergers often
      collects. I used
      the <a href="http://www.illustris-project.org/">Illustris
      Simulation</a> to prove that stellar halos which accreted less
      material have steeper gradients of metallicity and
      surface-brightness. My paper on the subject was published in the Astrophysical Journal [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00014">here</a>].</p>

	  values estimated by CMB
	  measurements.</figcaption>

      <h4>Senior Thesis: Fall 2013 &mdash; Spring
	2014<br>The distributions of baryons and dark
	matter in the universe</h4>
      <p>The cosmic baryon fraction - the fraction of the universe's mass which is in the form of ordinary matter - can be approximated
	through study of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Yet when
	measuring the collected baryonic mass in clusters of galaxies
	- some of the largest cosmic scales - observations
	consistently find fewer baryons than would be expected from
	the CMB measurements. Many theories predict that feedback
	mechanisms (such as shock heating or supernovae) expell a
	large fraction of baryons from the gravitational potential of
	bound systems.</p> <p>For my senior thesis, advised by <a
	href="http://www.princeton.edu/astro/people/faculty/neta/">Prof. Neta
	Bahcall</a>, I studied the distribution of baryons in a wide
	range of "halos", including galaxies, groups, and clusters. We
	investigated the stellar component of these systems with
	integrated optical light, and studied the hot gas content of
	groups and clutsers with available X-ray and SZ
	observations. One of the most significant recent advances has
	been the measurement of the mass of the Circumgalactic Medium,
	a cool gasesous component which surrounds galaxies like the
	Milky Way and which &mdash; according to observations by <a
	href="http://www.stsci.edu/~tumlinso/COS-Halos/Welcome.html">The
	COS-Halos Group</a> &mdash; could have as much baryonic mass as the
	galaxy itself. Combined with measurements such as these, we
	concluded that most halos of galacitc masses or higher have
	actually retained the majority of the cosmic baryon fraction!

	  different mechanisms than in the Sun.</figcaption>

      <h4>Harvard-Smithsonian REU: Summer 2013<br>
	Magnetic activity in very low-mass stars</h4>
      <p>Magnetic fields in the Sun are generated through a
	combination of convective and rotational motions at
	the <em>tachocline</em>, a boundary layer between the Sun's
	radiative core and convective outer envelope. However, stars smaller
	than the sun (less than around 30% of the Sun's mass) do not have a
	radiative core - they are <em>fully-convective</em>. However the 
	majority of these small stars are still extremely magnetically active
	- as measured by X-rays in their coronae, radio emission from energetic
	particles trapped in their fields, and emission lines sensitive to
	magnetic fields.</p>
      <p>As part of a summer research internship at Harvard, I
      collaborated with
	<a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/eberger">Prof. Edo
	Berger</a> and <a href="http://newton.cx/~peter/">Dr. Peter
	Williams</a> to study the X-ray activity in extremely low-mass
	stars known as Ultracool Dwarfs, or <em>UCDs</em>. I
	investigated the relationship between the activity levels in
	these UCDs and their rate of rotation.
	<p>I wrote an extensive final paper as part of the internship,
	  which can be viewed
	  [<a href="./files/Cook_REU.pdf">here</a>].  Our results have
	  been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal in two
	  parts: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6757">Paper I</a>
	  and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6758">Paper
	  II</a>. Furthermore, I presented a poster on my work as part
	  of the 223rd American Astronomical Society Meeting, and was
	  awarded one of six
	  undergraduate <a href="http://aas.org/grants-and-prizes/chambliss-astronomy-achievement-student-awards">Chambliss
	  Astronomy Acheivement Student Award</a> medals for my
	  work. The record of my poster's abstract can be found
	  [<a href="http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/abs/2014AAS...22344110C/">here</a>],
	  as well as a PDF of the poster

	<figcaption>Whether a quasar is Type I or Type II is believed
	to depend on the angle of orientation, and whether the
	obscuring torus blocks our view of the accretion disk. My work
	focused on quasars that are not clearly members of either

	<h4>Junior Research Paper: Spring 2013<br>Bizarre quasars in the BOSS survey</h4>
	<p>Quasars - the most powerful class of Active Galactic
	  Nucleii - are the extremely bright centers of distant
	  galaxies, lit up by the activity of their central
	  supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Quasars come in two
	  flavors, creatively known as Type I and Type II. Type I
	  quasars have blue, strong continuum emission in the X-ray
	  and broad emission lines, while Type II quasars show weak,
	  red continua and narrowly-peaked lines. This has led
	  astronomers to predict that the SMBHs in quasars are
	  surrounded by a thick, dusty torus. In this model, the
	  observed type depends on whether we view the central black
	  hole directly (which would produce a hot, blue continuum and
	  wide emission lines) or if the central regions are blocked
	  by the torus, and we only observe the less-energetic outer
	  regions of the quasar.</p>
      <p>During the spring of my junior year, I collaborated
      with <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/astro/people/faculty/strauss/">Prof. Michael
      Strauss</a> to investigate a strange class of quasars which
      showed properties of both types: they have wide emission lines,
      but weak, red continua. We dubbed these objects <em>Fat
      Quasars</em> for their low continua and wide lines. My work
      involved analyzing the <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/">Sloan
      Digital Sky Survey</a> and its catalog of quasars for objects
      matching our criteria, and then investigating what other common
      characteristics were shared by these quasars. You can find a
      copy of my junior paper
      [<a href="./files/Cook_JPSpring.pdf">here</a>]. My work also
      help identify errors in the SDSS Quasar Catalog's fitting
      software, and I was included as a coauthor in the updated <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4870">Data Release 10 Quasar Catalog</a>.</p>

	<figcaption>Many asteroids are non-spherical. When they
	rotate, they can periodically show more or less of their
	surface towards us, thereby changing the amount of sunlight
	reflected and their apparent brightness.</figcaption>
      </figure>

	<h4>Junior Research Paper: Fall 2013<br>Asteroid light curves in the HATNet survey</h4>
	<p>The common picture of an asteroid as a potato-shaped rock
	  in space is fairly accurate for all but the largest of
	  asteroids. Due to their non-spherical shape, asteroids can
	  reflect distinctly different amounts of sunlight towards us
	  if they rotate about a particular axis. This results in a
	  periodic <em>light curve</em>, or a dimming and brightening
	  in synch with their rotation rate.</p>
	<p>In the fall of my junior year, I worked
	  with <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~gbakos/">Prof. G&aacute;sp&aacute;r
	  Bakos</a> to measure the rotation periods of major asteroids
	  in our solar system. I accomplished this by locating the
	  known asteroids in archived images of
	  Prof. Bakos' <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~gbakos/HAT/">HATNet</a>
	  survey. Once the location of a given asteroid was calculated
	  for a particular date, its position on the sky was
	  translated into a pixel location on a recorded image, and
	  the asteroid's brightness could be calculated. Over many
	  nights of observation, we could calculate the rotation
	  period of an asteroid from archived images taken many years
	  ago. My methods and the results for one major test case
	  asteroid (Iris) were recorded in my junior paper
	  [<a href="./files/Cook_JPFall.pdf">here</a>].</p>

	<h4>Summer Research Program: Summer 2012<br>Galaxy mass and luminosity functions in cosmological simulations</h4>
	<p>For my first research project, I collaborated
	  with <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~cen">Dr. Renyue
	  Cen</a> to study the evolution of galaxies and dark matter
	  haloes in his simulation of galaxy growth. Using
	  supercomputers, Dr. Cen simulated the formation and growth
	  of galaxies and clusters throughout the entire history of
	  the universe. I assisted with measuring and parametrizing
	  the <em>Mass Function</em> and <em>Luminosity Function</em>
	  of galaxies at different times. These measurements tell us
	  how relatively common galaxies of different sizes are, and are 
	  major observables that we can compare between simulations
	  and observations of real galaxies. A brief write-up from the 
	  end of the program can be found [<a href="./files/Cook_USRP.pdf">here</a>].</p>
