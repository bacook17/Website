      <h2>My Past Research Projects</h2> Although my
      current scientific interests are primarily in
      cosmology, I have had the opportunity to
      complete several research projects in a variety
      of areas during the past few years. Below are
      descriptions of my recent work, as well as any
      major reports compiled as part of the research.

	  clusters (like Abel 1689) trace the

	  total baryon fraction should reach cosmic
	  values estimated by CMB
	  measurements.</figcaption>

      <h4>Senior Thesis: Fall 2013 - Spring
	2014<br>The distributions of baryons and dark
	matter in the universe</h4>
      <p>The cosmic baryon fraction - the fraction of
	the universe's mass which is in the form of
	ordinary matter - can be approximated through
	study of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Yet
	when measuring the collected baryonic mass in
	clusters of galaxies - some of the largest
	cosmic scales - observations consistently find
	fewer baryons than would be expected from the
	CMB measurements.</p>
      <p>For my senior thesis, advised by
	<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/astro/people/faculty/neta/">Prof. Neta
	Bahcall</a>, I am attempting to collect all available
	measurements of the baryon fraction on a wide range of cosmic
	scales, from the halos around galaxies to the outskirts of the
	most massive clusters. My work involves an extensive review of
	the literature in order to: 1) determine the hot gas fraction
	in galaxy clusters from X-ray and SZ measurements and 2)
	establish the stellar fraction on a variety of scales from
	optical clustering catalogs.</p>

      <h4>Harvard-Smithsonian REU: Summer 2013<br>
	Magnetic activity in very low-mass stars</h4>
      <p>Magnetic fields in the Sun are generated through a
	combination of convective and rotational motions at
	the <em>tachocline</em>, a boundary layer between the Sun's
	radiative core and convective outer envelope. However, stars smaller
	than the sun (less than around 30% of the Sun's mass) do not have a
	radiative core - they are <em>fully-convective</em>. However the 
	majority of these small stars are still extremely magnetically active
	- as measured by X-rays in their coronae, radio emission from energetic
	particles trapped in their fields, and emission lines sensitive to
	magnetic fields.</p>
      <p>As part of a summer research internship at Harvard, I
      collaborated with
	<a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/eberger">Prof. Edo
	Berger</a> and <a href="http://newton.cx/~peter/">Dr. Peter
	Williams</a> to study the X-ray activity in extremely low-mass
	stars known as Ultracool Dwarfs, or <em>UCDs</em>. I
	investigated the relationship between the activity levels in
	these UCDs and their rate of rotation.
	<p>I wrote an extensive final paper as part of the internship,
	  which can be viewed
	  [<a href="./files/Cook_REU.pdf">here</a>].  Our results have
	  been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal in two
	  parts: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6757">Paper I</a>
	  and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6758">Paper
	  II</a>. Furthermore, I presented a poster on my work as part
	  of the 223rd American Astronomical Society Meeting, and was
	  awarded one of six
	  undergraduate <a href="http://aas.org/grants-and-prizes/chambliss-astronomy-achievement-student-awards">Chambliss
	  Astronomy Acheivement Student Award</a> medals for my
	  work. The record of my poster's abstract can be found
	  [<a href="http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/abs/2014AAS...22344110C/">here</a>],
	  as well as a PDF of the poster
	  [<a href="./files/AAS_Poster.pdf">here</a>].

	<figcaption>Whether a quasar is Type I or Type II is believed
	to depend on the angle of orientation, and whether the
	obscuring torus blocks our view of the accretion disk. My work
	focused on quasars that are not clearly members of either
	type.</figcaption>

	<h4>Junior Research Paper: Spring 2013<br>Bizarre quasars in the BOSS survey</h4>
	<p>Quasars - the most powerful class of Active Galactic
	  Nucleii - are the extremely bright centers of distant
	  galaxies, lit up by the activity of their central
	  supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Quasars come in two
	  flavors, creatively known as Type I and Type II. Type I
	  quasars have blue, strong continuum emission in the X-ray
	  and broad emission lines, while Type II quasars show weak,
	  red continua and narrowly-peaked lines. This has led
	  astronomers to predict that the SMBHs in quasars are
	  surrounded by a thick, dusty torus. In this model, the
	  observed type depends on whether we view the central black
	  hole directly (which would produce a hot, blue continuum and
	  wide emission lines) or if the central regions are blocked
	  by the torus, and we only observe the less-energetic outer
	  regions of the quasar.</p>
      <p>During the spring of my junior year, I collaborated
      with <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/astro/people/faculty/strauss/">Prof. Michael
      Strauss</a> to investigate a strange class of quasars which
      showed properties of both types: they have wide emission lines,
      but weak, red continua. We dubbed these objects <em>Fat
      Quasars</em> for their low continua and wide lines. My work
      involved analyzing the <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/">Sloan
      Digital Sky Survey</a> and its catalog of quasars for objects
      matching our criteria, and then investigating what other common
      characteristics were shared by these quasars. You can find a
      copy of my junior paper
      [<a href="./files/Cook_JPSpring.pdf">here</a>]. My work also
      help identify errors in the SDSS Quasar Catalog's fitting
      software, and I was included as a coauthor in the updated <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4870">Data Release 10 Quasar Catalog</a>.</p>

	<figcaption>Many asteroids are non-spherical. When they
	rotate, they can periodically show more or less of their
	surface towards us, thereby changing the amount of sunlight
	reflected and their apparent brightness.</figcaption>
      </figure>

	<h4>Junior Research Paper: Fall 2013<br>Asteroid light curves in the HATNet survey</h4>
	<p>The common picture of an asteroid as a potato-shaped rock
	  in space is fairly accurate for all but the largest of
	  asteroids. Due to their non-spherical shape, asteroids can
	  reflect distinctly different amounts of sunlight towards us
	  if they rotate about a particular axis. This results in a
	  periodic <em>light curve</em>, or a dimming and brightening
	  in synch with their rotation rate.</p>
	<p>In the fall of my junior year, I worked
	  with <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~gbakos/">Prof. G&aacute;sp&aacute;r
	  Bakos</a> to measure the rotation periods of major asteroids
	  in our solar system. I accomplished this by locating the
	  known asteroids in archived images of
	  Prof. Bakos' <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~gbakos/HAT/">HATNet</a>
	  survey. Once the location of a given asteroid was calculated
	  for a particular date, its position on the sky was
	  translated into a pixel location on a recorded image, and
	  the asteroid's brightness could be calculated. Over many
	  nights of observation, we could calculate the rotation
	  period of an asteroid from archived images taken many years
	  ago. My methods and the results for one major test case
	  asteroid (Iris) were recorded in my junior paper
	  [<a href="./files/Cook_JPFall.pdf">here</a>].</p>

	<h4>Summer Research Program: Summer 2012<br>Galaxy mass and luminosity functions in cosmological simulations</h4>
	<p>For my first research project, I collaborated
	  with <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~cen">Dr. Renyue
	  Cen</a> to study the evolution of galaxies and dark matter
	  haloes in his simulation of galaxy growth. Using
	  supercomputers, Dr. Cen simulated the formation and growth
	  of galaxies and clusters throughout the entire history of
	  the universe. I assisted with measuring and parametrizing
	  the <em>Mass Function</em> and <em>Luminosity Function</em>
	  of galaxies at different times. These measurements tell us
	  how relatively common galaxies of different sizes are, and are 
	  major observables that we can compare between simulations
	  and observations of real galaxies. A brief write-up from the 
	  end of the program can be found [<a href="./files/Cook_USRP.pdf">here</a>].</p>
