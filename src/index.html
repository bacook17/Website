      <h2>Welcome to my home page!</h2>
      <p>I am an astrophysics PhD student at Harvard, with an interest in data science and machine learning.</p>
      <p>My main scientific focus is on the stellar populations of
      galaxies: what kinds of stars are in a galaxy, and what can this
	tell us about how the galaxy formed? My past <b>Astronomy Research</b> is described under the <b>Experience</b> tab (link to the left).</p>
      <p>In use high-performance computation to advance my research. I
      am pursuing a secondary sepcialization in Computational Science
      and Engineering as part of my PhD, which focuses on machine
      learning and data science. Highlights from my
      past <b>Computational Projects</b> are listed under
	the <b>Experience</b> tab.</p>
      <p>The <b>Experience</b> tab also lists my <b>Professional Activities</b>, which highlights my engagement in science communication, teaching, and outreach.</p>
      <p>You can also view my <b>Academic CV</b> and <b>Resume</b>, as well as a list of my <b>Publications</b>. I am always happy to talk to anyone who is interested in my work. Please feel free to <b>Contact Me</b> by email, Twitter, or LinkedIn.</p>
