     <h2>Personal Info and Research</h2>
   <p>
   Originally from Keene, NH, I'm now a senior in the department of
Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University. My main research
interests include Cosmology, Large Scale Structure, and Low-Mass
Stars. I am also dedicated to increasing public engagement in science
and improving science education. See
my <A HREF="./Cook_CV.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</A> for more information
about me and a list of my publications.<p>

During the summer of 2013, I worked as a member
of <A HREF="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~eberger/The_Berger_Research_Group/Main_Page.html">Edo
Berger's Time-Domain Research Group</A> at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics, through the
CfA's <A HREF="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/REU/">Astronomy REU</A>, a
wonderful program that I would highly recommend to any
undergraduates. In collaboration
with <A HREF="http://newton.cx/~peter/about-me/">Dr. Peter
K. G. Williams</A> and Prof. Berger, I investigated the magnetic
properties of Ultracool Dwarfs (UCDs), very low-mass stars and brown
dwarfs. By studying the X-ray emission coming from the stellar
coronae, we hope to understand how magnetic fields (which through
poorly understood mechanisms heat the coronae) are connected to
rotation in the UCDs. Upon further investigation, we found evidence
that X-ray activity may decrease with faster rotation- contrary to the
behavior of more massive stars - and we believe that the magnetic
topology may play a larger role in X-ray emission in these objects
than the magnetic field strength alone. Our work was recently
submitted to the Astrophysical
Journal: <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6757">Paper I</A>
and <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6758">Paper II</A> can be found
on the astrophysics arXiv. I also presented a poster at the January
2014 AAS meeting, a copy of which can be
found <A HREF="./images/AAS_Poster.pdf"> here </A>.<p>

My most recent <A HREF="./Cook_JPSpring.pdf">Junior Paper</A>, in
collaboration
with <A HREF="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~strauss/">Prof. Michael
Strauss</A>, centered on the identifcation and properties of quasars
found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The classical model of quasar
properties places quasars into two categories, Type I and Type II,
based on whether they are shielded by dust clouds. My work centered on
identifying a sample of "fat quasars" which do not match the
characteristics of either type, but instead share properties of both
Type I and Type II.<p>

My first <A HREF="./Cook_JPFall.pdf">Junior Paper</A> was supervised
by <A HREF="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~gbakos">Prof. Gáspár
Bakos</A>. This involved analyzing data from his HATNet extrasolar
planet search in order to find minor planets (asteroids) within our
solar system and generate their light curves. Through studying the
period of these light curves (i.e. how fast the minor planets rotate),
we hope to be able to improve our understanding of minor planets'
development
history <a href="http://www.minorplanet.info/ObsGuides/Misc/photometryguide.htm#Why%20Are%20Asteroid%20Lightcurves%20Important?">and
much more</a>.</p>

<p>
During the summer of 2012, I collaborated
with <A HREF="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~cen/">Dr. Renyue Cen</A>
as part of
Princeton's <A HREF="http://www.princeton.edu/astro/undergraduate/usrp/">Undergraduate
Summer Research Program</A>, another great research opportunity for
Princeton students. My work analyzed the mass and luminosity functions
of galaxies in
Dr. Cen's <A HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...742L..33C">cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations</A> from z~9 to
z~0.5. Click <A HREF="./Cook_USRP.pdf">here</A> to view the brief
summary I wrote on some of the results.

<p>
On campus, I am the President of the Princeton Society of Physics
Students. We're a group dedicated to making the life of a Princeton
physics (or astrophysics!) student more rewarding, more social, and
more fun! As President, I am in charge of organizing the majority of
our events (with the fantastic help of the Physics Department staff),
coordinating all of our officers and their projects, and being the
voice of the club to students and the public. Recently, I also
authored the club's constitution. To learn more about our
organization, click on our logo to the right!
